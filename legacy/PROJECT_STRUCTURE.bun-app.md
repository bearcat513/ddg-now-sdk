# Project structure

A reusable blueprint for a Bun + React + PocketBase app that is **usable as a UI and as an API**,
documents itself with OpenAPI, issues API keys for scripts, and can notify a chat when something
finishes.

Copy this file into a new repo and work down it. Everything is a convention, not a framework:
there is no hidden magic, only files in agreed places. Throughout, `<app>` stands for the project's
short name (`<APP>` for its upper-case form) — replace it as you copy.

## 1. Stack

| Concern | Choice | Why not the usual thing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Runtime, bundler, test runner, package manager | **Bun** | One tool. No webpack/vite/jest/ts-node to keep in sync. |
| HTTP server | `Bun.serve()` with a `routes` table | No Express. Routes are a plain object, params and methods included. |
| Frontend | React 19 via **HTML imports** | `src/*.html` are build entry points; Bun transpiles and bundles the `.tsx` they reference. |
| Styling | Tailwind + a small `components/ui` set | Copy-in components (shadcn style), not a component dependency. |
| Storage & auth | **PocketBase** in its own container | Collections, rules, user accounts and a dashboard without writing an auth system. |
| Privileged server logic | PocketBase **hooks** (`pb_hooks/`) | The only place allowed to hold privilege — see §7. |
| Orchestration | Docker Compose | App and database come up together with one command. |

Everything else — schema inference, generation, export, notifications — is plain TypeScript in
`src/`, with no framework between it and the runtime.

**One rule holds the layout together:** a file's directory says what it may touch.
`lib/` may touch nothing but its arguments, `server/` may touch env and the network,
`pb_hooks/` may touch privilege. Nothing reaches up.

## 3. The three layers

### `src/lib/` — shared, pure

Imported by the server *and* the browser, so it must not import `process.env`, `node:*`, or
anything that only exists in one of them. This is where the domain lives: types, validators,
normalizers, formatters, parsers.

The high-value pattern here is the **normalizer pair**:

```ts
export const DEFAULT_PREFERENCES: Preferences = { theme: "system", accentColor: "blue" };
export function normalizePreferences(value: unknown): Preferences { /* … */ }
```

The server normalizes what arrives over the API, the UI normalizes what it renders, and a record
written before a field existed comes back with the default rather than `undefined`. A body typed
by hand into `curl` lands in exactly the shape the UI would have produced.

### `src/server/` — Bun only

Each module owns one concern and exports functions, not a class. Storage functions take the
caller's credential as their first argument and are `async`. Errors leave as `ApiError`.

### `src/components/` — the browser

`ui/` is generic and reusable; `app/` is this product; `docs/` renders the API document. A
component never calls `fetch` directly — it calls `lib/api.ts`, which is the only place the URL
space appears on the client side.

## 4. The server

### The route table is the only map

`src/index.ts` holds every route in one `Bun.serve({ routes })` object, grouped by section with
comment rules. Reading it top to bottom is reading the API.

```ts
const server = serve({
  routes: {
    ...authRoutes,                                  // spread in from server/auth.ts

    "/api":            { GET: handler(() => Response.json({ /* index */ })) },
    "/api/health":     { GET: handler(health) },
    "/api/openapi.json": { GET: handler(openApiDocument) },

    "/api/things":     { GET: guarded(listThings), POST: guarded(createThing) },
    "/api/things/:id": {
      GET:    guarded<{ params: { id: string } }>((token, req) => getThing(token, req.params.id)),
      DELETE: guarded<{ params: { id: string } }>((token, req) => deleteThing(token, req.params.id)),
    },

    // Unknown API paths must not fall through to the SPA's HTML.
    "/api/*": handler(req => fail(`No such endpoint: ${req.method} ${path(req)}. See GET /api.`, 404)),

    "/docs": docs,   // the API reference, its own HTML entry point
    "/*":    index,  // the SPA, for everything else
  },
  development: process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production" && { hmr: true, console: true },
});
```

Two ordering rules earn their keep: **`/api/*` before `/*`** (or a typo'd endpoint returns the
SPA's HTML with a 200 on it), and **repeated route shapes get a factory** — `shareRoutes("things")`
returns the `GET`/`POST`/`DELETE` triple so two record types cannot drift apart.

### `server/http.ts` — the shape of every answer

Small and worth copying verbatim:

```ts
export class ApiError extends Error {
  constructor(message: string, readonly status = 400) { super(message); }
}

export const fail = (message: string, status = 400) =>
  Response.json({ error: message }, { status });

export function handler<T>(fn: Handler<T>): Handler<T> {
  return async req => {
    const started = performance.now();
    let response: Response;
    try {
      response = await fn(req);
    } catch (error) {
      const status = error instanceof ApiError ? error.status : 400;
      response = fail(error instanceof Error ? error.message : "Unexpected error", status);
    }
    console.log(`${req.method} ${pathOf(req)} → ${response.status} (${ms(started)}ms)`);
    return response;
  };
}
```

- **Every error is `{ error: string }`**, with a status. One shape for the UI, `curl`, and the
  docs page alike.
- **Every route is wrapped**, so a `throw` anywhere below becomes a correct response. Route
  bodies never `try`/`catch` for the sake of the response shape.
- **Every request is logged** with its status and duration.
- Parameter readers (`intParam`, `boolParam`, `enumParam`) throw `ApiError` with the offending
  value quoted: `"limit" must be a number (got "lots").`

### `guarded` — the one-line auth wrapper

```ts
const guarded = <T,>(fn: (token: string, req: Request & T) => Response | Promise<Response>) =>
  handler<T>(req => fn(requireToken(req), req));
```

A route is public if it uses `handler`, authenticated if it uses `guarded`. That is the whole
access-control surface in the route table, and it is visible on every line.

### Error messages are sentences

Not codes, not `Bad Request`. `An API key cannot manage API keys — sign in to issue or revoke one.`
The message is what the UI shows and what a script's author reads at 3am.

## 5. Auth and sessions

**Three ways in, one identity.** `readToken(req)` returns a credential from, in order:

1. `X-API-Key: <app>_…` — a long-lived key for scripts (checked first: a script that sends one
   means it, and must not silently fall back to a browser cookie).
2. The `<app>_session` httpOnly cookie — what the UI uses.
3. `Authorization: <token>` — a raw user token, for scripts holding one already.

Everything downstream passes that one string through without caring which it is.

```ts
export function sessionCookie(req: Request, token: string, maxAge = WEEK): string {
  const parts = [`${SESSION_COOKIE}=${encodeURIComponent(token)}`, "Path=/", "HttpOnly",
                 "SameSite=Lax", `Max-Age=${maxAge}`];
  if (isSecureRequest(req)) parts.push("Secure");   // follows the request, not NODE_ENV
  return parts.join("; ");
}
```

Three details that are easy to get wrong:

- **`HttpOnly`** — page scripts cannot read the token, so an XSS cannot walk off with a session.
- **`SameSite=Lax`** — another site cannot drive this API with your session.
- **`Secure` follows the request, not `NODE_ENV`.** Tying it to the environment looks safer and
  behaves worse: a production container reached over `http://localhost` sets a cookie Safari
  refuses to store, and sign-in fails with nothing to show for it. Read `x-forwarded-proto` first
  so a TLS-terminating proxy still gets the flag.

**Shape-check a token before sending it on.** An expired token makes the database treat the caller
as anonymous, and an anonymous caller matches no ownership rule — so the reply is a perfectly empty
list with a 200 on it. Decoding the JWT's `exp` locally turns that silent empty account into
"sign in again". This proves nothing about authenticity; the signature is the database's to check,
and it does, on every request.

## 6. API keys

A key is how a cron job or a script reaches the API without a week-long session cookie.

| Decision | The rule |
| --- | --- |
| Format | A fixed prefix + random secret: `<app>_…`. The prefix is the whole test for "is this a key", and it is unambiguous: a session token is a JWT, which always begins `eyJ`, so no token can be mistaken for a key. |
| Storage | **Only a SHA-256 of the key is stored.** The raw value is returned by the issuing response once and never exists again. |
| Issuing | The one operation needing privilege (it hashes a secret and hands it back), so it lives in a **hook route**; the app proxies to it with the caller's own token. |
| Listing / revoking | Ordinary record calls — the collection's own rules let an owner read and delete their keys, and nothing else. |
| Reach | Exactly what its owner reaches. A middleware resolves the key to the same authenticated identity a session produces, so the collection rules are the only access model whichever credential arrived. |
| **A key may not manage keys** | Issuing and revoking require a *session*. Revocation is how you recover from a leak, so it is the one thing a leaked key must not be able to do. Enforce it in both layers — a sentence from the app, a refusal from the database. |
| Expiry | Optional, capped (ten years is not "never", but it is past the life of any script). |
| Last used | Written at most every few minutes, so a busy key does not cause a write per request. |

The public shape never includes the secret:

```ts
type ApiKey       = { id: string; name: string; createdAt: string; expiresAt: string; lastUsedAt: string };
type IssuedApiKey = ApiKey & { key: string };   // the one response that carries it
```

## 7. Storage and access control

**Access control lives in the database, not in the app server.**

Every request carries the caller's own credential, and a client is built *per request* from it:

```ts
export function clientFor(credential?: string): PocketBase {
  const client = new PocketBase(POCKETBASE_URL);
  client.autoCancellation(false);            // server-side there is no "navigated away"
  if (!credential) return client;            // only registration and sign-in
  if (isApiKey(credential)) { /* send it as the key header */ }
  else client.authStore.save(credential, null);
  return client;
}
```

The consequence is the point: **the app server holds no credentials and can therefore grant no
access of its own.** A bug in a route cannot leak another account's records, because the database
evaluates its own rules against the real caller. Never reintroduce a superuser client for ordinary
reads and writes. If something genuinely needs privilege, it becomes a hook route.

**Error mapping** happens in one place (`toApiError(error, context)`), and it distinguishes cases
callers act on differently:

- status `0` → `502`, "the database is unreachable at …" — this server is fine, its database is not.
- status `401` → "Your session has expired — sign in again", not a failure of what was attempted.
- field errors → the first one, named: `email: must be a valid email address` beats
  `Failed to create record`.

### Migrations

`docker/pb_migrations/<timestamp>_<what>.js`, one file per change, baked into the image. Collections,
fields, and — the part that matters — **API rules**:

```js
// Owner-only, on every rule a collection has.
listRule = viewRule = createRule = updateRule = deleteRule = "owner = @request.auth.id";
```

A schema change is a new migration file, never a dashboard edit: a fresh volume comes up without it.

### Hooks

`docker/pb_hooks/` is server-side JS run by the database's own JS VM, not by Bun. It is the only
place privilege is allowed, and it holds one route per thing that needs it (issuing keys, granting a
share) plus the global middleware that honours an API key.

> **The one rule people trip over:** a hook body cannot see its own file's scope. Declare what a
> handler needs *inside* the handler, or `require` it there. Code that breaks this registers fine
> and fails only at runtime.

`main.pb.js` is the only `.pb.js` file; everything else is a plain module exporting `register()`,
loaded in a `try`/`catch` so one broken module does not take down the rest.

## 8. API docs (OpenAPI + /docs)

Three surfaces, **one source**:

```
src/server/openapi.ts  ──┬──▶  GET /api/openapi.json   (Postman, Bruno, Insomnia, codegen)
   the document          ├──▶  GET /api                (the index, printed from the same document)
                         └──▶  /docs                   (a React page that fetches and renders it)
```

- The document is **the only list of endpoints.** `GET /api` prints its index rather than keeping a
  second copy, so a renamed route cannot go on being advertised under its old name.
- **Limits are imported, never retyped.** `TELEGRAM_LIMITS`, `METADATA_LIMITS`, `FIELD_TYPES` come
  from `lib/`, so the document cannot promise a bound the server does not keep.
- **OpenAPI 3.0.3**, not 3.1 — every tool reads 3.0 today.
- The file a browser downloads is the same bytes the tools fetch.
- `/docs` is **its own HTML entry point**, not a view inside the app: it is read by people who have
  not signed in, and the document it renders needs no credential. It re-renders whatever is in the
  document, so an endpoint added in `openapi.ts` appears there with nothing else to change — and a
  page that disagreed with the document would be a bug in the document.
- The docs page is **callable**: pick a credential (API key or user token), fill the parameters,
  send it, see the response. That is what makes the reference worth opening twice.

Small helpers keep the document readable:

```ts
const ref = (schema: string) => ({ $ref: `#/components/schemas/${schema}` });
const jsonResponse = (description: string, schema: Json) =>
  ({ description, content: { "application/json": { schema } } });
```

`GET /api` should also answer the questions a reader has before the endpoint list: how to
authenticate, what the error shape is, what the common query options mean.

## 9. Telegram notifications

Notifying a chat when a long job finishes is the highest-value-per-line feature in this stack.
A bot token is one `curl` away from BotFather and needs no inbound webhook.

**Split across two files, deliberately:**

| File | Holds | Never holds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lib/telegram.ts` | The settings shape, its normalizer, and the message text | The bot token — it is a credential and never reaches the browser |
| `server/telegram.ts` | The bot token and every call to Telegram | Anything the UI needs to render |

**Two places a bot can come from.** An operator may set `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, and then nobody has
to make a bot at all; an account that would rather use its own pastes one in, and that one wins.
Neither is required — with no bot anywhere, the settings page says so and nothing is sent.

**Linking a chat: a pairing code, not a chat ID.** Nobody knows their own chat ID. The app shows a
short code from an unambiguous alphabet (`ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ23456789` — no `O`/`0` or `I`/`1`
to read back wrong), the user sends it to the bot, and the app confirms. The code has a TTL.

**Validate a token before storing it**, so a pasted mistake is refused by name rather than at the
first notification that fails to arrive:

```ts
export const isBotToken = (v: string) => /^\d{5,}:[A-Za-z0-9_-]{30,}$/.test(v.trim());
```

**Settings worth having** (all normalized, all in `lib/`):

```ts
type NotificationSettings = {
  enabled: boolean;
  chatId: string;  chatLabel: string;       // the label is for the settings page to show
  events: { finished: boolean; failed: boolean };
  minRows: number;                          // small runs say nothing — a 25-row preview is not news
  apiKeyOnly: boolean;                      // a run from the editor has its result on screen already;
};                                          // one from a cron job at 3am is why this exists
```

**Calling Telegram**: one `callTelegram(botToken, method, body)` helper with an 8s timeout, where
every failure — refused token, unreachable network, a chat the bot cannot post to — comes back as
**one sentence**, because that sentence is what the settings page shows and what `last_error` keeps.
Telegram's own `description` is the useful part; the status alone is not.

**Notifications never block the request.** Send after the response is decided, and let a failure
land in `last_error` rather than failing the job that succeeded.

## 10. The UI

### Entry points

Every `src/**/*.html` is a build entry point, found by a glob — adding a page is adding an HTML
file, with nothing to register:

```html
<!-- src/index.html -->
<html><body><div id="root"></div>
  <script type="module" src="./frontend.tsx"></script>
</body></html>
```

```tsx
// src/frontend.tsx — HMR-safe root
const elem = document.getElementById("root")!;
(import.meta.hot.data.root ??= createRoot(elem)).render(<StrictMode><App /></StrictMode>);
```

### Component tiers

| Directory | What belongs there | Test |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `components/ui/` | `button`, `input`, `card`, `select`, `popover`, `label`, `textarea` — generic, copied in, styled with `cva` + `cn()` | Would it be the same in an unrelated product? |
| `components/app/` | `Dashboard`, `Sidebar`, `SettingsPanel`, `ApiKeys`, `TelegramNotifications`, `ShareDialog` — this product | Does it name a domain concept? |
| `components/docs/` | `DocsPage`, `OperationCard`, `SchemaView`, `MethodBadge`, `CodeBlock` | Does it render the API document? |

### `lib/api.ts` is the only client that knows URLs

One typed object (`api.things.list()`, `api.keys.create()`), one place that adds
`credentials: "include"`, one place that turns `{ error }` into a thrown `Error`. A component
that calls `fetch` directly is a bug.

### Theme and preferences on first paint

Carry the account's preferences **on the session object** rather than fetching them after mount —
otherwise the app renders a default theme and then corrects itself in front of the user. Apply the
theme with a `dark` class plus `style.colorScheme`, and honour `system` by listening to
`matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)")`. The `/docs` page applies the same preferences, so it
does not flash white against the app.

## 11. Configuration and secrets

`.env.example` is the **documented** list of every variable; `.env` is the copy that runs. Bun
auto-loads it and Compose reads it from the repo root, so `bun dev` and `docker compose up` see the
same values. Group it with comments:

```bash
# --- image versions (compose build args) ---
PB_VERSION=0.40.4
BUN_VERSION=1.4.0

# --- host ports (docker-compose.override.yml) ---
API_PORT=3000
PB_PORT=8091          # not 8090: that default is commonly already taken

# --- database superuser (the dashboard login only) ---
PB_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
PB_ADMIN_PASSWORD=change-me-please

# --- Telegram notifications (optional) ---
# TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456789:AA...

# --- visible to user-supplied scripts ---
# Only variables named <APP>_SCRIPT_* are visible to a user snippet as `env`.
# <APP>_SCRIPT_API_TOKEN=...
```

**If users can supply code that runs server-side**, two rules are not optional: run it in a
`node:vm` context with a timeout, and give it **only** variables carrying an agreed prefix. Sign-up
is open, so a snippet is untrusted code and the server's secrets stay out of its reach. The bot
token is deliberately not prefixed.

## 12. Docker Compose

```
docker-compose.yml           the app and the database. Publishes NO host ports.
docker-compose.override.yml  local only: publishes 3000 and 8091, mounts hooks/migrations.
```

Compose auto-loads an override only when it discovers the base file on its own — a deploy target
naming a file with `-f` gets the base file alone. That one asymmetry keeps `localhost:3000` working
locally *and* keeps the database's admin UI off the internet wherever this is deployed.

Worth copying:

- **An anchor for shared service settings** (`restart`, log rotation) so a change applies to both.
- **`${VAR:?message}`** for anything required — interpolation happens before any build starts, so a
  missing value fails immediately with a sentence, not halfway through.
- **Tag images by version** (`image: app:${VERSION}`) so bumping the version rebuilds rather than
  silently reusing the old image.
- **`depends_on: condition: service_healthy`** so the app's first request does not race the
  migrations that create its collections.
- **Blank the database's admin credentials in the app container.** It signs in as its own users and
  holds no credentials of its own, so the superuser password has no business being there.
- **Bake hooks and migrations into the image**; mount them only in the override. A bind mount whose
  source the daemon cannot see resolves to an empty directory that *hides* them — which means no
  collections and no superuser, with no error.
- **A profile-gated one-shot service** for resetting the superuser (`docker:init`). Profiles keep it
  from *running*, not from being *parsed* — its variables are interpolated on every compose command.
- **A named volume for the data.** `down` keeps it; `down -v` is what deletes it. Say so in a comment.

Scripts: `docker:up` (`up -d --build`), `docker:down`, `docker:logs`, `docker:init`.

## 13. Tests

`bun test`, with tests beside the code they cover.

| Suffix | Runs | For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `*.test.ts` | Node-ish environment | Pure `lib/` logic and server units |
| `*.test.tsx` | Same | Component logic that needs no DOM |
| `*.dom.test.tsx` | `@happy-dom/global-registrator` | Rendering and interaction |

**One end-to-end API test is worth more than the rest combined.** `server/api.test.ts` starts a
throwaway database container, registers two accounts, and drives the real HTTP surface:
register → sign in → create → share → read as the other account → export → issue a key → call with
the key → revoke → confirm it now fails. That test is what proves the access rules, not just the
routes.

Gate it on the container being available so `bun test` still passes on a machine without Docker,
and print a skip line rather than a green false negative.

## 14. Adding a feature, end to end

The order that avoids rework:

1. **Types and normalizer** → `src/lib/<feature>.ts` (+ its test). Shape first; both sides agree here.
2. **Migration** → `docker/pb_migrations/<ts>_<feature>.js`: the collection, its fields, and
   owner-only rules on all five.
3. **Storage** → `src/server/<feature>.ts`: functions taking a token, errors through `toApiError`.
4. **Privilege, only if unavoidable** → a `pb_hooks/` route the server proxies to with the caller's
   token. Declare dependencies *inside* the handler.
5. **Routes** → a block in `src/index.ts` with a comment rule, `guarded` where it needs an account.
6. **The document** → `src/server/openapi.ts`: paths, schemas, limits *imported* from step 1.
   `/api` and `/docs` update themselves.
7. **The client** → `src/lib/api.ts`, then the panel in `src/components/app/`.
8. **Tests** → the unit test from step 1, plus a leg in the end-to-end test proving the access rules.
9. **`.env.example`** if it added a variable, **README** if it added a user-visible capability.

## 15. Conventions at a glance

**Naming**

| Thing | Convention |
| --- | --- |
| Files | `camelCase.ts` for modules, `PascalCase.tsx` for components |
| Tests | Beside the source: `foo.ts` → `foo.test.ts`; DOM tests `*.dom.test.tsx` |
| Routes | Plural nouns, kebab-case: `/api/script-templates/:id/shares` |
| API fields | `camelCase` in JSON, whatever the database uses in storage — map at the boundary |
| Timestamps | ISO-8601 everywhere in the API; convert at the boundary, once (`toIso`) |
| Env vars | `SCREAMING_SNAKE`; user-script-visible ones carry the `<APP>_SCRIPT_` prefix |
| API keys | `<app>_` prefix, so identifying one is a string test |
| Constants | Exported `UPPER_SNAKE` from `lib/`, imported by the document — never retyped |

**Rules**

- Every error response is `{ error: string }` with a sentence in it.
- Every route goes through `handler`; every authenticated route through `guarded`.
- Every storage call takes the caller's credential. The server holds none of its own.
- Access control lives in the database's rules. A route is not a security boundary.
- Limits are defined once in `lib/` and imported by the validator, the document, and the UI.
- `lib/` imports nothing environment-specific. If it needs `process.env`, it belongs in `server/`.
- A schema change is a migration file, not a dashboard edit.
- `/api/*` catches unknown endpoints before `/*` serves the SPA.
- Comments explain **why**, especially where the obvious choice is the wrong one.

**Commands**

```bash
bun install
cp .env.example .env
bun run docker:up      # app on :3000, database on :8091
bun dev                # or run the server on the host against the same database
bun test
bun run build
```
