/**
 * API keys: a long-lived credential for scripts, kept as a hash.
 *
 * A session token expires in a week and lives in a cookie, which is right for
 * a browser and useless for a cron job. A key is a second way to prove who you
 * are, and because the middleware in pb_hooks/keys/ turns one into the same
 * `@request.auth` a token produces, every rule written in the previous
 * migrations applies to it unchanged — a key can reach exactly what its owner
 * can reach, and nothing else.
 *
 * Only the SHA-256 of a key is stored, and the field is hidden, so the raw
 * value exists in one response and nowhere else. A database that leaks hands
 * over nothing usable. SHA-256 rather than bcrypt is deliberate: these are 40
 * random characters from the server's own CSPRNG, not a human-chosen password,
 * so there is no dictionary to slow an attacker down with and no reason to pay
 * a KDF's cost on every request.
 *
 * `create` and `update` are locked to superusers. Issuing a key has to hash it
 * and hand the raw value back exactly once, which no client can be trusted to
 * do — POST /api/ddg/keys does it instead. `list`, `view` and `delete` are the
 * owner's, so revoking is deleting the record.
