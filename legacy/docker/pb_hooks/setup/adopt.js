/**
 * Hands the single-tenant leftovers to the first account that registers.
 *
 * Everything created before the accounts migration has no owner, which means
 * no rule matches it and nobody can see it. Rather than stranding that data,
 * the first user to sign up inherits it — the tool was theirs alone until the
 * moment accounts existed.
 *
 * Only ever the *first* account: for every later registration this is a no-op,
 * so a second user cannot walk in and claim anything.
 *
 * Note the shape of the handler below. A hook body runs in its own scope and
 * cannot see anything declared in this file outside it, so the collection list
 * and every helper live *inside* the callback. Hoisting either one out is the
 * kind of change that still registers cleanly and then fails at runtime.
