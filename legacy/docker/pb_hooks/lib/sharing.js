 * Sharing a configuration or a script template with another account.

 * This lives in PocketBase rather than in the Bun server for two reasons.
 * Resolving an email address to an account needs to read the `users`
 * collection, which no user token may do — keeping it here means the address
 * book stays closed while addresses remain shareable. And writing `sharedWith`
 * from here goes through the app directly, so it is not blocked by the same
 * rules that stop a client from editing its own share list.
 *
 * Read-only sharing: a recipient may list and view the record, and nothing
 * else. That is enforced by the collection rules, not here.
