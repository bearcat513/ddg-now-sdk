/**
 * `owner` and `sharedWith` are set here, never by the request body.
 *
 * The collection rules decide who may touch a record; these hooks decide what
 * the record says about itself. Without them a caller could create a record
 * already owned by someone else, or widen its share list by hand on an
 * ordinary update.
 *
 * Only *request* hooks are registered, so the sharing endpoints — which save
 * records directly through the app — are unaffected. Superusers are left alone
 * too: the dashboard, migrations and maintenance scripts are the one place
 * ownership is set by hand, including leaving it unset.
