 * The PocketBase token lives in an httpOnly cookie, so page scripts cannot
 * read it, and it is handed straight back to PocketBase on every request that
 * needs data. This server never validates it itself and never acts on anyone's
 * behalf: PocketBase evaluates its own collection rules against the real
 * caller, which is what keeps one account out of another's records even if a
 * route here gets something wrong.
 *
 * An `Authorization: <token>` header is accepted too, for scripts holding a
 * token from PocketBase directly.
 *
 * An `X-API-Key` header is the third way in, for scripts that should not have
 * to sign in at all. A key is forwarded to PocketBase exactly like a token,
 * and a hook there turns it into the same `@request.auth` a token produces —
 * so the collection rules are the only access model, whichever credential
 * arrived. Nothing here validates a key either; PocketBase does that too.
